#
# A set of adaptors to allow device classes to interact with radio interfaces.
# At the moment, the main purpose of this abstraction is to prevent the need
# for device classes to know specifics about radio technology and focus
# on the device aspects only.
#
# In the future, this will be a useful point in the architecture to add
# an intelligent message scheduler, that learns the report patterns of
# specific devices, builds a timeslotted schedule, and schedules transmits
# into mostly free slots.
#
# NOTE: This also might include intelligent power level selection based
# on RSSI reports from different devices.
